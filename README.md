## OVERVIEW
This excel dashboard analyses the road traffic accidents, as it is essential to understand why accidents happen and how they can be prevented. To make data-driven decision to identify high-risk areas, common causes, vulnerable road users, key road safety challenges. As a result, better and more targeted road safety policies can be developed. 

This anaysis explores speed limit, road conditions, weather conditions, junction control, light condition to create insights to analyze the frequency and
severity of accidents and to also identify high-risk factors contributing to accidents.

## OBJECTIVE
- Analyze the frequency and severity of accidents.
- Identify high-risk factors contributing to accidents.
- Provide data-driven recommendations for road safety improvements.
- Address key road safety challenges.

## DATASET SUMMARY
- Total Accidents - 307,972
- Numner of Casualities - 417,882
- Number of Vehicles - 563,301

## KEY INSIGHTS
### Accident trends
- Most accidents occurred in urban areas, mainly involving car drivers.
- Large cities were identified as accident hotspots.
- Many accidents happened in 30 mph zones, showing risks at lower speeds.
- Driver behaviour and heavy traffic were the main causes, not weather conditions.
- Most accidents at 86% are slight in severity.

### Monthly Accident Trends 
- November recorded the highest number of accidents (29,095).
- Shorter daylight, increased commuting, and busy periods in autumn and winter contribute to higher accident rates.

### Effect of light condition
- Most casualties (304,962) occurred during daylight when roads are busiest.
- Good visibility during the day does not always prevent accidents, dur to human behaviour.
- The least casualties (1,538) occurred in unlit darkness.

### Weather's Impact
- Most accidents occurred during clear weather conditions not in poor weather conditions, contrary to common assumptions.
- Drivers tend to be more confident and risky in clear weather.
- Bad weather encourages cautious driving, resulting in fewer accidents despite hazardous conditions.

### Speed Limits 
- Most accidents occurred in 30 mph zones, majorly urban and high-traffic areas.
- Limited shared space between vehicles and pedestrians increases risk.

### Road conditions
- Most accidents and casualties occur on dry roads.
- Driver behaviour has a greater impact on road accidents than road surface conditions.
- Drivers are more cautious on wet or icy roads, resulting to fewer accidents.

### Junction control
- Give way or uncontrolled junctions had the highest accidents (150,045)
- Many accidents are linked to missing or inaccurate data of junction control.
- Controlled junctions with traffic lights or officers have the fewest accidents (460).

### Time of the day
- Accidents peak in the afternoon during school and work commute times.
- Heavy traffic increases vehicle and pedestrian collisions.
- Driver fatigue and inattention raise accident risk.

## TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES 
- Excel
- Data Cleaning
- Pivot Table
- Data Visualization and Dashboard
- Interactive slicers

## KEY RECOMMENDATIONS 
- Enhanced Police Patrols: Increase patrols during peak hours in high-traffic and high-risk areas to protect vulnerable road users.
- Awareness & Education: Run public campaigns and school programs to promote safer road behaviour.
- Traffic & Speed Control: Improve signals, signage, speed enforcement, and 30 mph zone compliance.
- Traffic Control Improvements: Upgrade junctions, add stop signs, and apply targeted interventions.
- Data-Driven Actions: Use detailed accident data, accurate data recording to address high-risk times and locations as well as detailed accident data support.
- Driver & Pedestrian Safety: Strengthen driver training, protect pedestrians near schools and shops, and enforce seatbelt, helmet, and mobile phone laws while driving.
